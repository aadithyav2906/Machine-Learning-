# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Projects  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning projects** implemented using Python.  
The goal is to explore different ML algorithms, experiment with real-world datasets, and build models that can be used for data-driven problem solving.  

Each project folder contains:  
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with implementation and analysis  
- Dataset (if small, else link provided)  
- README.md explaining project details  
- Requirements file for dependencies
